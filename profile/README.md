## Hi there 👋 this is ignyteX labs =)
We do some fun projects around here like developing bare-bones libraries and also some more sophisticated projects like the full control software of a self-driving tank. <br>
Also, there are some other bits and pieces like our minecraft server from not so long ago. <br>
Even tough we like to take an effort in trying to do things as best-practice as possible please don't expect "good" code and especially don't expect well maintained code.

## Overview
### Tank
We decided to build a tank, just for fun. things will come to github as we code them
### embedded
toqix has done some embedded libraries. go take a look
### libraries
singlejson, remotecontroller and other stuff is (and will be) available for non embedded plattforms as well.
### minecraft
we have done some fun plugins, most of them are now old relics that nobody wants to touch, but mlgrush-2 and bedwars are two finished products.
also invman is supposed to work at some point, until then you can see the relatively up to date minecraft-plugin-manager written in python.
### the ignyte.link domain
is supposed to be a functional website at some point. who knows what is going to happen
<br>
#### ignyteX-labs
We coundn't come up with a better name so we stuck to this one =)
